# drain-completions.sh — surface this Claude Code session's Copilot completions
# into its own context.
#
# Fires on PostToolUse (any tool), UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart:startup. Each
# bridge writes events tagged with its Claude Code session id; this drain only
# delivers and only retains rows whose tag matches the firing session, dropping
# stale and untagged rows by TTL. Move-aside pattern (rename queue → process
# snapshot → append kept rows back) ensures concurrent bridge appends during
# the drain are not overwritten — they land in the freshly-created queue file
# whose contents the drain never touches. mkdir-lock serializes concurrent
# drains so two `mv` operations cannot race for the same snapshot.
#
# Empty queue or missing session id → no injection, no context pollution.
