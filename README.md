# Copilot Companion

GitHub Copilot delegation for Claude Code **and Codex CLI** — **dual-host plugin with subagent-isolated architecture**.

The entire public surface is a single subagent shipped inside this plugin (one
Markdown variant for Claude Code, one TOML variant for Codex CLI). Main Claude
or main Codex has **zero** direct MCP visibility into copilot-bridge; the MCP
server is declared only in the subagent's frontmatter and only the subagent
sees it. There is no slash command, no user-scope MCP registration, no skill,
no session opt-in, no pause. Host hooks are used only for materialization,
dependency prewarm, heartbeat, and completion drain. Sends use
`parallel: "auto"` by default: the bridge invokes Copilot's built-in `/fleet`
orchestrator only when the task looks broad enough to benefit; see
[Parallel orchestration](#parallel-orchestration).

> **Host selection.** `setup.sh` defaults to `--host both`. Pass `--host claude`
> or `--host codex` only when you intentionally want one host surface.

> **Claude packaging caveat.** Claude plugin-bundled subagents ignore
> `mcpServers`, `hooks`, and `permissionMode` frontmatter for security. This
> product therefore materializes `templates/copilot-companion.md` into
> `~/.claude/agents/copilot-companion.md`; that standalone agent is the one
> that owns the private MCP bridge.

## Installation

`claude plugin install` only accepts plugins registered in a marketplace — there
is no `--plugin-dir` flag on the install subcommand. For persistent local
installs we ship a small `marketplace.json` alongside `plugin.json`, so adding
this directory registers a one-plugin dev marketplace that you can install from.

### Persistent install from this directory

```bash
# Register the local directory as a marketplace (one-time)
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/copilot-companion

# Install the plugin from that marketplace
claude plugin install copilot-companion@copilot-companion-dev
```

Claude Code copies the plugin to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`. On the first
session after install, the `SessionStart` hook runs `hooks/install-deps.sh`,
which installs the bridge-server's `node_modules` to
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/bridge-server/` (persistent across plugin updates) and
symlinks it into `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bridge-server/node_modules` so Node's
ESM resolver finds `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` via ancestor-directory walk.

To pick up changes you make to this directory, bump `version` in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, then:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update copilot-companion-dev
claude plugin update copilot-companion@copilot-companion-dev
```

### Session-scoped (no install, fastest iteration)

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/copilot-companion
```

Loads the plugin for one session directly from source — no marketplace, no
cache. Note that `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` is not created for `--plugin-dir`
runs; `install-deps.sh` falls back to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.plugin-data/`
so ESM resolution still works. Alternatively run `bash setup.sh` once to
install deps directly into `bridge-server/node_modules/`.

### Via a published marketplace (end users)

Once submitted and approved:

```
/plugin marketplace add <marketplace-source>
/plugin install copilot-companion@<marketplace-name>
```

## Install for Codex CLI

Current Codex CLI supports plugin marketplaces and `codex plugin add`. Codex
marketplaces must have `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` at the marketplace
root and plugin source under `./plugins/<name>`, so this dual-host source tree
builds a Codex marketplace package before publishing or local marketplace
testing:

```bash
node scripts/build-codex-marketplace.mjs --out dist/codex-marketplace
codex plugin marketplace add dist/codex-marketplace
codex plugin add copilot-companion@copilot-companion --json
```

The generated package installs plugin-scoped Codex hooks from
`hooks/hooks-codex.json`; it does not mutate `~/.codex/hooks.json`.

For an already-published marketplace, the user-facing install path is:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add <marketplace-source>
codex plugin add copilot-companion@<marketplace-name> --json
```

For this source checkout, use the local dev setup path when you do not want a
marketplace package/install round trip. It materializes the custom TOML agent
and dev hooks directly:

```bash
bash setup.sh --host codex
```

What that does, end-to-end:

1. **Materializes the TOML subagent** to `~/.codex/agents/copilot-companion.toml` (the only place Codex looks for unmanaged subagents — `~/.codex/agents/` and `<repo>/.codex/agents/` per `agent_roles.rs`). `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in the bridge MCP `args` is substituted to the absolute install path at materialization time, because Codex MCP `args` are runtime literals (no `${VAR}` expansion).
2. **Merges source-checkout dev hook entries** into `~/.codex/hooks.json` via `scripts/install-codex-hooks.mjs`. Pre-existing user hooks are preserved (read-merge-backup-write); each managed entry carries `_managed_by: "copilot-companion"` so a later `--uninstall` only removes our entries. A timestamped backup is written before each modification. Published Codex packages use plugin-scoped hooks from `hooks/hooks-codex.json` instead.
3. **Skips Claude-specific steps**: no `~/.claude/settings.json` permission injection (Codex's permission/sandbox/trust model is not addressed by this plan), no `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (Codex's `features.multi_agent` is `Stable` and on by default).
4. **Writes a diagnostic marker** at `~/.codex/copilot-companion/.host` containing the literal `codex` so you can `cat` it to confirm what was installed where.

After setup, run `codex` and ask main Codex to delegate to Copilot (e.g. _"have copilot audit the auth module"_) — main Codex spawns the `copilot-companion` subagent via `spawn_agent`, the bridge starts inline, and the flow mirrors the Claude path. Session id continuity is handled server-side: Codex injects `_meta["x-codex-turn-metadata"].session_id` on every MCP request, and the bridge reads it directly — there is no `claude_session_id`/`host_session_id` to forward by hand.

**Completion delivery on Codex V1 `multi_agent`.** When the `copilot-companion` subagent reaches a final status, Codex's V1 completion watcher injects the subagent's terminal message into main's session conversation, but main does not necessarily auto-resume. Main reads the previously-injected message on its next user prompt; send any prompt (`any updates?`) to give main a turn and the result surfaces in conversation history. `multi_agent_v2` is still treated as under-development for this product; do not enable it until its public behavior is stable and verified against this bridge.

If you'd rather install for both hosts in one shot:

```bash
bash setup.sh --host both
```

To remove only the Codex hook entries from `~/.codex/hooks.json` without uninstalling anything else:

```bash
node scripts/install-codex-hooks.mjs --plugin-root "$(pwd)" --uninstall --yes
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22**
- **GitHub Copilot CLI authenticated.** Install (`npm i -g @github/copilot`), then run `copilot` once interactively to complete GitHub OAuth. The daemon resolves the binary in order: `$COPILOT_BIN` → `command -v copilot` → `/opt/homebrew/bin/copilot`. On Linux, export the absolute path explicitly:
  ```bash
  export COPILOT_BIN=$(command -v copilot)
  ```
- **Agent Teams env var (Claude only)** — `export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in the shell (required for SendMessage-based thread continuity). On Codex this is unnecessary: `features.multi_agent` is `Stable` and on by default.

## Permissions (user setup)

The subagent invokes five split MCP tools: `mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_send`,
`mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_wait`, `mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_status`,
`mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_reply`, and
`mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_cancel`. On Claude, it also runs one minimal
`echo "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"` probe so the bridge can tag queue rows to the
current Claude session. Without explicit allow rules, the first invocation in a
session can surface a permission prompt — even with `defaultMode: "auto"`.
Plugin-level `settings.json` cannot declare permissions (Claude Code honors
only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` there), so the entries must live in your
user or project settings.

**Pick whichever fits your install path:**

### A. Source checkout (cloned repo, or running `--plugin-dir`)

Run once from the repo root:

```bash
node scripts/install-permissions.mjs --yes
```

`setup.sh` already runs this as Step 5; the standalone command exists so you can re-run or pre-empt without re-running the full setup. The script is idempotent, takes a timestamped backup of `~/.claude/settings.json` before writing, and preserves the existing order of your allow list.

### B. Marketplace install (`/plugin install copilot-companion@…`)

The plugin source lives under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<hash>/...`, which isn't a stable path to hand-type. Use either:

1. **Click "Yes, don't ask again"** on the first permission prompt — Claude Code writes the entry to `~/.claude/settings.json` for you. One-time only.
2. **Pre-populate `~/.claude/settings.json`** before your first session:
   ```json
   {
     "permissions": {
       "allow": [
         "mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_send",
         "mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_wait",
         "mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_status",
         "mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_reply",
         "mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_cancel",
         "Bash(echo \"$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID\")"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
   Or use `/permissions` inside Claude Code to add the rule via UI.

### Optional log-tailing diagnostics

Only useful if you want to inspect the bridge or daemon logs without prompts:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(tail:*)",
      "Bash(ps:*)",
      "Read(//Users/<your-user>/.claude/copilot-companion/runtime/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note on glob syntax**: the double slash marks an absolute path in Claude Code's permission syntax. Prefer the host-specific runtime directory over broad `/tmp` access.

### Project-scope alternative

Drop the same JSON into `.claude/settings.local.json` per repo if you'd rather only allow Copilot in specific projects (the file is gitignored by default and not checked in).

## Public surface

You don't call the MCP tool directly. Main Claude reads the subagent's
`description` and spawns it via `Agent()` when the user asks for Copilot
delegation, status checks, replies, or cancellation.

### Internal MCP surface (subagent-only)

```
copilot_send({ task, cwd, mode?, template?, template_args?, thread?, max_wait_sec?, parallel? })
copilot_wait({ job_id, max_wait_sec? })
copilot_status({ job_id?, verbose? })
copilot_reply({ job_id, message })
copilot_cancel({ job_id })
```

`cwd` is required on every `send` and must be the absolute target repo or
worktree path. The bridge, CLI client, and daemon all reject missing `cwd`
instead of defaulting to their own process working directory; this prevents a
delegated review from silently running in the companion/plugin checkout.

`send` enqueues the task and returns `status: "still_running"` with a
`job_id` immediately — the worker runs in the background. The subagent
then loops on `wait` (each up to `max_wait_sec`, default 480, max 1200 —
a single 20-min cap for all modes, sized to accommodate `/fleet` runs
that decompose into long-running sub-agents), emitting one short line
between iterations to reset the host's 600s stream-idle watchdog. The
underlying daemon caps each Copilot prompt at 25 min (`PROMPT_TIMEOUT_MS`
in `scripts/copilot-acp-daemon.mjs`). Codex callers must set
`tool_timeout_sec = 1320` on `[mcp_servers.copilot-bridge]`; environment
variables only reach the server process and do not extend the host's MCP
tool-call budget. Claude uses the subagent MCP env timeout.

Terminal statuses returned by the bridge: `completed`, `failed`,
`cancelled`, `stuck` (supervisor trip — model misbehavior), **`timeout`**
(model turn did not finish within the wait budget — recoverable; main
should read `meta.digest_path` for partial sub-agent output before
deciding whether to re-dispatch), and **`unreachable`** (bridge socket
/ daemon process dead — `meta.detail` distinguishes `bridge_timeout`
from `bridge_daemon_unreachable`).

### Runtime files and progress digest (`meta.digest_path`)

For every job that gets far enough to register a Copilot prompt, the
bridge maintains private runtime files under
`~/.{claude,codex}/copilot-companion/runtime/` by default:

- `copilot-acp.sock` — user-private daemon socket.
- `copilot-bridge.log` and `copilot-acp-daemon.log` — bridge/daemon logs.
- `prompts/copilot-acp-<promptId>.jsonl` — prompt event streams.
- `digests/copilot-digest-<jobId>.md` — smart transcript digests.
- `completions.jsonl` — completion queue drained by hooks.

Set `COPILOT_RUNTIME_DIR` to override the root for tests or advanced
debugging. The bridge creates the directory with `0700` permissions and
writes runtime files with private modes where applicable.

The bridge uses `COPILOT_RUNTIME_ADAPTER=acp` by default. Set
`COPILOT_RUNTIME_ADAPTER=sdk` to opt into the experimental
`@github/copilot-sdk` backend. The SDK backend uses SDK session events,
`abort()`, `resumeSession()`, and the bundled Copilot runtime unless `COPILOT_BIN`
is set, while preserving the bridge's existing `send`, `wait`, `status`,
`reply`, and `cancel` response shapes. SDK reasoning effort is unset by default
because support is model-specific; set `COPILOT_SDK_REASONING_EFFORT` only for
models verified to accept it. The configured `default-model` must also be
available to the SDK runtime for the signed-in Copilot account. SDK in-flight
prompts are intentionally marked non-resumable after a bridge restart until the
adapter persists enough SDK prompt state to reattach safely. ACP remains the
default until live side-by-side parity checks cover completion drain, digest
generation, cancel, reply, timeout, and host restart behavior.

The digest is refreshed:

- on every `status` call against the job,
- on every supervisor interim alert (~60s during silence),
- on every terminal emit (final snapshot).

Contents (each section auto-skipped when empty):

- Header (job id, status, mode, template, thread, started/terminal timestamps, age).
- The task as dispatched.
- Final / partial assistant message (concatenated `message` chunks; partial on timeout).
- `/fleet` sub-agent reports (each paired with its `outputPreview`).
- Files touched (deduped paths from `tool_call.locations`, with touch counts).
- Tool-call summary (counts grouped by `kind`, plus sub-agent invocation count).
- Todos snapshot (the latest `plan` event's entries).

The path is surfaced via `meta.digest_path` on every terminal response
and via `digest_path` on the `still_running` wait response and on every
`status` reply. When the digest file exists, the MCP tool result also includes
a `resource_link` content block for `copilot-digest://<jobId>`. The bridge
advertises the same digest files through MCP `resources/list`,
`resources/templates/list`, and `resources/read`, so hosts that support MCP
resources can read the markdown digest without relying on local filesystem
paths. The file paths remain in the JSON payload for debugging and for hosts
whose resource UX still needs live verification. Reading the digest is the
canonical way for the parent agent to track progress without making another
bridge round-trip.

## Thread continuity

Multi-turn Copilot conversations are preserved differently per host:

1. Claude: first send omits `thread`; the bridge auto-generates `companion-<jobId>`, the subagent emits `MY_THREAD=<value>`, and later `SendMessage` resumes the subagent so it can pass that thread back.
2. Codex: the TOML agent does not emit or parse `MY_THREAD`; the bridge reads Codex's MCP `_meta["x-codex-turn-metadata"].session_id` and persists a host-session-to-thread mapping under `~/.codex/copilot-companion/threads/by-host-session/`.
3. Main's context only carries the opaque subagent handle; it never needs to carry the thread name.

### SendMessage invocation form (important)

`SendMessage` validates its `message` param as a tagged union of *(a)* plain-text string or *(b)* a protocol object with `type ∈ {shutdown_request, shutdown_response, plan_approval_response}`. A raw `{"action":"send",...}` object matches neither and fails with `InputValidationError: path ["message"]` ("expected string" on one branch, "no matching discriminator" on the other). Always pass the payload as a **JSON-encoded string**, and always include a `summary`:

```js
// correct — message is a STRING
SendMessage({
  to:      <stored agentId>,
  summary: "follow-up task to copilot",      // 5-10 words, required
  message: '{"action":"send","task":"..."}'  // JSON-encoded string
})

// wrong — message is a raw object, fails schema validation
SendMessage({ to: <id>, message: {"action": "send", "task": "..."} })
```

The same rule applies to the Agent-spawn `prompt` field: pass the JSON payload as a string.

## Parallel orchestration

Every `send` accepts `parallel: "auto" | "always" | "never"`.

- **`auto`** is the default. The bridge prepends `/fleet ` only when the task
  looks broad enough to benefit.
- **`always`** forces Copilot's built-in `/fleet` orchestrator.
- **`never`** skips `/fleet` for strictly linear or single-source work.

When `/fleet` is used, Copilot's orchestrator decomposes the task, dispatches
isolated sub-agents in parallel where the work allows, polls for completion,
and synthesizes a final answer. Each sub-agent runs in its own context window
with shared filesystem access. Decomposition, dispatch, and synthesis all
happen inside Copilot — the bridge's only contribution is the slash command.

The natural fit is template-shaped:
- **`general`** — multi-file refactors, cross-component features, parallel ANALYZE.
- **`research`** — multi-source web research; sub-agents read different sources concurrently.
- **`plan_review`** — per-claim verification of a plan against the codebase.

Use `parallel: "never"` when the task is strictly linear or single-source
(one-line typo fix, one-source research question, trivially small plan).
`/fleet`'s decomposition-analysis step adds turn budget even when it concludes
"no parallelism here", so skipping it is faster for genuinely linear work.

```jsonc
// default — bridge decides whether /fleet is worth it
copilot_send({ task: "refactor authentication across api/, ui/, and tests/" })

// force /fleet for a broad audit
copilot_send({ task: "audit auth, billing, and API routes", parallel: "always" })

// skip /fleet for trivial linear work
copilot_send({ task: "fix the typo in foo.ts:42", parallel: "never" })
```

When a task hits `status: "timeout"`, the bridge's `content` includes a
`parallel: "never"` retry suggestion as one of several recovery options —
main decides which to try.

## Design invariants

1. **Strict isolation.** The `copilot-bridge` MCP server is bundled with the plugin but the subagent's `tools:` list is the only path through which it's invoked. Main never calls the bridge directly.
2. **No activation lifecycle.** The bridge is spawned per subagent invocation by Claude Code's plugin MCP machinery. There's nothing to `start`, `stop`, or `pause`.
3. **Bounded blocking.** `send` returns immediately with `still_running`; each `wait` returns within `max_wait_sec ≤ 1200` (single 20-min cap for all modes). The companion's per-iteration "still running" emission resets Claude Code's 600s stream-idle watchdog; Codex callers raise `tool_timeout_sec` (the shipped TOML template sets `tool_timeout_sec = 1320`).
4. **Orphan safety net.** Completion events are appended to the private runtime `completions.jsonl` queue with `consumed:false`; wait-terminal responses flip to `consumed:true`; the drain hook surfaces only unconsumed entries.
5. **Rubber-duck always on.** Appended to every `send` server-side for every template except `plan_review` (which has its own critique instructions baked in). Not in the schema.
6. **Model is config.** Read from the host-routed `default-model` at worker start; the bridge forwards that value to the daemon so the Copilot process respawns when the configured model changes. Never a user tool parameter.
7. **Node deps persist, code doesn't.** `bridge-server/node_modules` lives under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` and survives plugin updates; bundled code under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is re-copied on update.

## Subagent tool surface

The subagent declares these tools (full list in this plugin's `agents/copilot-companion.md` frontmatter):

```
mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_send, mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_wait,
mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_status, mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_reply,
mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_cancel, Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob,
WebFetch, TodoWrite
```

The `mcp__copilot-bridge__copilot_*` tools are the canonical dispatch surface.
All non-MCP tools exist for diagnostics, artifact handling, and
self-sufficiency. See the frontmatter "Tool surface" and "Forbidden" sections
for when each is appropriate.

## Diagnostics

`setup.sh` writes a one-line marker file under each host's directory at install time, advisory-only, useful when a system has both hosts installed and you want to confirm what landed where:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/copilot-companion/.host    # → "claude" if installed
cat ~/.codex/copilot-companion/.host     # → "codex"  if installed
```

Actual host-routing at runtime is decided by the `COPILOT_COMPANION_HOST` env var injected into the bridge's MCP `env:` block (set to `"codex"` literal in the materialized Codex TOML; not set on Claude, which falls back to the default). The marker files are NOT a fallback signal — with concurrent installs on both hosts, a fallback would be ambiguous.

To inspect host selection from inside a bridge process:

```bash
# Each bridge spawn logs its detected host once at startup.
grep '"event":"bridge.startup"' ~/.claude/copilot-companion/daemon.log
grep '"event":"bridge.startup"' ~/.codex/copilot-companion/daemon.log
```

(The log file is the bridge's structured JSONL log under the host's `copilot-companion` state directory; each entry includes a `host_detected` field with `claude` or `codex`.)

For a compact environment report:

```bash
node scripts/doctor.mjs
node scripts/doctor.mjs --json
```

## Development

- `node --check` should pass on every `.mjs` after edits.
- `jq` is required for hook delivery.
- Tests: `node --test $(find bridge-server lib scripts hooks templates -name '*.test.mjs')`
  — covers `bridge-server/{server,validation}.test.mjs`, `lib/{state,host,log,prompt-inspect,prompt-supervisor,heartbeat}.test.mjs`, `scripts/{build-codex-marketplace,copilot-acp-daemon,install-codex-hooks}.test.mjs`, `hooks/drain-completions.test.mjs`, and `templates/copilot-companion.toml.test.mjs`.
- Build and validate the generated Codex marketplace package:
  `node scripts/build-codex-marketplace.mjs --out dist/codex-marketplace`, then install it in an isolated `CODEX_HOME` during release checks.
- Validate the Claude plugin manifest: `claude plugin validate .` from the plugin root.

## Out of scope

- Main Claude speaking to the bridge directly.
- Skill file / slash commands (gone in v6.1).
- Session opt-in, pause (removed).
- MCP elicitation (`NEEDS_USER_INPUT:` flow) — deferred to a future version.
